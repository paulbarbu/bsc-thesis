* ken thompson - writing a bogus compiler - reflections on trusting trust - p761-thompson.pdf
* how does uefi work?
* will I be able de decrypt parts of the bundle as it arrives,
or will I have to store it in flash and then do it for the whole thing?
* what happens if the flashiong fails? boot-loop? or revert to old firmware?
* say about what happens if we try to read the microcontroller (will everything delete?)
* trying a normal reprogram is no longer possible after initial programming since
 JTAG will only allow deleting the contents of the flash?
